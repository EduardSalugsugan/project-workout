## How to run this program:    
In order to succesfully run this program and get all of its features, either download the entire project as a zip or clone 
the repository to download the files. All of the java files as well as the two .txt files, "standardstrengthexercises.txt" and 
"standardcardioexercises.txt" need to be downloaded and placed into the same directory. When the program is run for the first
time, it is recommended that the user first set up an account using the "login" button on the homepage when it opens. Once an
account is created and logged in, the user can then use all of the features of the program including creating custom exercises, 
workout routines, and meal plans. Other .txt files will be added once the program is run, such as the accounts.txt file which 
will store all of the user profiles on the computer being used. This file is not required to be downloaded however, as the 
program will create the file for the user when they create the first account. For more information on the project itself, 
please visit the Wiki porition of the repository.
